			<p>During the Covid, I discovered my interest in baking. I started experimenting with different sweet treats
				and sharing them with my family and friends. I began incorporating seasonal flowers in decorating my
				cakes recently. It was during this creative streak that I came up with the idea of mixing flowers in the
				background and the cake in the middle for this project.
